# Sentiment analysis on customer feedback by Orange
# This is a part of my Thesis project
This project uses Orange Data Mining to perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback.
It includes a visual workflow (.ows file) that processes customer review text, transforms it into features, and applies classification models to detect sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
Ideal for business analysts or researchers aiming to explore customer satisfaction trends via no-code machine learning tools.
